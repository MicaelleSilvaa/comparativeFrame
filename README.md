# comparativeFrame

This is an activity proposed by the coding teacher at the university, with the aim of classifying and comparing, in a table, the 5 languages that will be covered in this subject (Javascript, Java, PHP, Python and C#) and another one of your interest.
Also adding a column to express my opinion on each of the languages.
